<h2> YOLACT</h2>

Implement `YOLACT` paper and apply to the custom dataset.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02689


This project is my first time trying to implement network using `pytorch` so maybe some code is not exactly right and can be unstable.

``` 
train_model.py : train network that contains sub-network in '/structure'
test_model.py : test network.
```

Some configuration params in `/utils/config.py`.  
Test result using strawberry img is in `/image/predict` folder.
